Please review the following code snippets for potential security vulnerabilities:

1. **SQL Injection**: Check for any user inputs being directly included in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Look for instances where user input is rendered on a webpage without proper escaping.
3. **Insecure Direct Object References**: Ensure that any user-supplied IDs are validated against the user's permissions.
4. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Verify that sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) is not being logged or exposed in error messages.
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Review server and application configurations for security best practices.

If you find any vulnerabilities, please document them with the following information:

- **Description**: A brief summary of the vulnerability.
- **Location**: The file and line number where the vulnerability exists.
- **Recommendation**: Suggested steps to remediate the vulnerability.
